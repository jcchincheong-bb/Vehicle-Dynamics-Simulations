# Investigations

## 0.0 Audi Longitudinal Kinematics

### 0.0.1 Specifications

- We want to simulate accleration 0 - 60 kph (16.67 m/s)
    - plot a graph of speed vs time and see if the time is actually 6.7s
    - we use the data from the data sheet

### 0.0.2 Assumptions

1. No incline
2. Equilibrium at maximum speed 
3. Full electric vehicle â†’ torque is constant 
4. Rolling resistance is constant and take maximum value for worst case scenario 
5. Tyre Class C1 w/ Fuel Efficiency class A [2] 
6. Negligble tyre deformation thoughout acceleration 
7. Road is dry 
8. Assume gear ratio is the same (not true but still)

### 0.0.3 Parameters

- Mass: $m = 2145 kg$ [1]
- Maximum torque $\mathcal{T}= 545 Nm$ [1] *3
- Maximum speed 112 mph $\dot{x}^{max}= 50.0685 m/s$  [1]
- Drag Factor $k_d=0.8233\frac{kg}{m}$
- Initial speed $\dot{x}_0=0 m/s$
- Tire diameter: $d=0.4953 m$ [2] *6
- $C_{rr}=0.0065$ [3], *4 *5
- Gear box ratio: $i=0.1$ [4] *8

### 0.1.0 Equations

$$
\ddot{x}=\frac{2\mathcal{T}}{d\cdot m\cdot i}-C_{rr}\cdot g-\frac{k_d \cdot\dot{x}^2}{m}  \quad (1)
$$

### 0.1.1 Simulation Model

### 0.2.0 Results

- We get around 40 m/s at 6.7s

### 0.3.0 Issues

- We failed to account for the driving slip which would have lowered the acceleration
- Gear box ratio could also hv degradation

### 0.4.0 Rework

![image.png](assets/image.png)

Using the friction model of 1.0, we derived a new set of ODEs and formed the simulation as shown.

![image.png](assets/image%201.png)

The results were much closer.

## 1.0 Tire Model

### 1.0.1 Specifications

Develop a model to meet the data points for tire slip in icy and wet conditions. The Pacejka model will be used and for different conditions, the model parameters will be found. 

$$
\mu(\kappa)=c_1\left[1-e^{-c_2\kappa}\right]-c_3\kappa
$$

### 1.0.2 Data

For icy and wet road conditions, the following information was determined experimentally. 

![image.png](assets/image%202.png)

### 1.0.3 Parameters

| Parameters | Wet | Icy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c1 | 0.86 | 0.2 |
| c2 | 33.078 | 6.628 |
| c3 | 0.36 | 0 |

### 1.1.0 Method of Finding Parameters

Use the fact that the linear part is asymptote of the function so the slope and intercept gives us c1 and c3. 

Then you plug in values to find c2

### 1.1.1 Programs for Pacejka Model

After the model parameters are found, they can be implemented into a Simulink model as shown.

Simulink Model for 

To observe the relationship between friction coefficient and slip, we also implemented a simple Matlab script to plot the graph. 

```matlab
%% Setup
% Wet
c1w=86/100;
c2w=33078/1000;
c3w=36/100;
f_mue_w = @(x)(c1w*(1-exp(-c2w*x))-c3w*x);
% Icy
c1i=2/10;
c2i=6628/1000;
c3i=0;
f_mue_i = @(x)(c1i*(1-exp(-c2i*x))-c3i*x);

%% Ploting friction against slip in different road conditions
fplot(f_mue_w,[0,1])
hold on
fplot(f_mue_i,[0,1])
hold off
grid
legend('wet','icy')
xlabel('braking slip')
ylabel('coef. of friction')
ylim([0 0.9])
```

### 1.1.2 Extension of Model for Parameterization

To see how the friction coefficient varies with different speeds of the vehicle or tires, we extended the models.

```matlab
%% Ploting friction against tire speed in different road conditions and vehicle velocities (braking)
f_slip = @(v_v,v_w)((v_v-v_w)/(v_v));
for i=5:5:50
    slip_val = f_slip(i,0:0.1:i);
    plot(0:0.1:i,f_mue_w(slip_val),"-")
    hold on
    plot(0:0.1:i,f_mue_i(slip_val),"--")
end
xlabel('Tire speed [m/s]'); ylabel('Coef. of Friction [-]')
hold off

%% Ploting friction against driving speed in different road conditions and tire velocities (accelerating)
f_slip = @(v_w,v_v)((v_w-v_v)/(v_w));
for i=5:5:50
    slip_val = f_slip(i,0:0.1:i);
    plot(0:0.1:i,f_mue_w(slip_val),"-")
    hold on
    plot(0:0.1:i,f_mue_i(slip_val),"--")
end
xlabel('Tire speed [m/s]'); ylabel('Coef. of Friction [-]')
hold off
```

| c1 | 0.86 | 0.2 |
| c2 | 33.078 | 6.628 |
| c3 | 0.36 | 0 |

### 3.1.3.? Discussion of Comfort and Safety

|  | Comfort | Safety | Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wheel Mass | Improved for higher mass at frequency above wheel eigenfrequency | Less safe for higher mass at freq.  between the eigenfrequencies | Wheel mass needs to be **balanced**  |
| Tire Stiffness | Improved for lower stiffness for frequency above wheel eigenfrequency | Improved for lower stiffness at frequency above wheel eigenfrequency | Tire should be **soft** (but **hard enough to transfer** longitudinal and lateral **forces** and be durable) |
| Body Stiffness | Improved for lower stiffness near the body eigenfrequency | Improved for lower stiffness near the body eigenfrequency | Keep the stiffness **low** but **high enough to keep the wheels on the ground** and doesn't get completely compressed |
| Body Damping | Improved for higher damping at body eigenfrequency
Less for higher damping at frequencies above body eigenfrequency $\omega>\omega_B$ | Improved for higher damping at the two eigenfrequencies 
Less safe for higher damping between the eigenfrequencies  | We need to **consider** the excitation **frequency** |
| Body Mass | Improved for higher body mass at frequencies above body eigenfrequency | Less safe for higher mass at frequencies below the wheel eigenfrequency | **Balance** the body mass  |
